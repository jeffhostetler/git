- Use Kevin's clock ID work, i.e. make it possible for fsmonitor to report back
  its idea of the clock (increase the protocol version to 2)

- Consider sending multiple file names per packet.

- Do include the NUL in the file name, potentially stripping a trailing NUL on
  the receiving side.

- Include a test case to verify that `fsmonitor--daemon` works as a drop-in for
  `core.fsmonitor`.

- Concurrent client access should not be refused. For named pipes, achieve that
  by being careful to ensure that there is always at least one listener open.

- Set permissions on the named pipe/Unix socket correctly. No need to let
  random users spy on worktrees' activity to which they have no read access.

- Document the `core.fsmonitor=:internal:` setting.

- Drop the lists older than the .git/index file (modulo fuzz). Do that by
  updating an uint64_t in the producer, and then (under a new lock, say,
  queue_tail_lock) cull the tail end of the queue just before serving the
  next client.

  - This requires a bit more care, as we could be in a worktree; In the main
    worktree, .git/index is usually under the same top-level directory and
    therefore reported by ReadDirectoryChangesW(), but in worktrees that is
    not necessarily the case.

- Report via Trace2 to see whether it is healthy:
  - How many files were reported in one go (and how much the buffer was
    filled by them)
  - How much time was spent queuing new paths
  - How long the clients were blocked
  - How much time was spent serving clients
  - If ever possible, report memory fragmentation

- Skip reporting directories (meaning: make sure we know the type of a path)
  - To do that, be smart and look whether a path refers to a file in a
    subdirectory, then make sure that the subdirectory is marked as such
  - Maybe over-report, and only mark known directories?
  - Or not worry about this for now, it's okay to report directories, use
    Trace2 to measure the impact of this

- Exclude .git/

- Exclude submodules somehow.

- Handle when a file is removed and a directory added in its place: this needs
  to be reported as "deleted".

- Handle when a directory is renamed: only the directory name is reported, but
  we need to report all paths.

- Possibly prime the daemon's `paths` hashmap by reading the index and adding
  all tracked files (and untracked files, if the untracked extension is
  present)

- Use the `untracked` cache to initialize the set of paths to report upon
  startup.

- Consider maybe only supporting this fsmonitor when an untracked cache is
  present.

- Use a different cookie file in worktrees (.git is not a directory there)

- Consolidate `special_path()` into a non-platform-specific form, using callbacks

- Document why we're not listening for `.git/index`.

- Modify simple-ipc.c to server clients in individual threads, not serialized
  in the main thread.

- In thread-safe-pkt-line patches, add a test (using
  `t/helper/test-pkt-line.c`) to verify the thread-safety of it all.
