simple-ipc API
==============

The simple-ipc API is used to send an IPC message and response between
a (presumably) foreground Git client process to a background server
daemon process.  The server process must already be running.  Multiple
client processes can simultaneously communicate with the server
process.

Communication occurs over a named pipe on Windows and a Unix domain
socket on other platforms.  Clients and the server rendezvous at a
previously agreed-to application-specific pathname (which is outside
the scope of this design).

This IPC mechanism differs from the existing `sub-process.c` model
(Documentation/technical/long-running-process-protocol.txt) and used by
applications like Git-LFS because the server is assumed to be very
long running, such as a system service.  How the server is started is
also outside the scope of the IPC mechanism.

The IPC protocol consists of a single request message from the client and
an optional request message from the server.  For simplicity, pkt-line
format (Documentation/technical/protocol-common.txt) is used.
Both messages are treated as a NUL terminated string.  Messages may
contain multiple lines.  The pkt-line layer hides chunking and buffering
details.  A flush packet marks the end of the message content.

The actual format of the client and server messages is application
specific.  The IPC layer transmits and receives an opaque string without
any concern for the content within.
